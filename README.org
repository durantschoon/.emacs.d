#+TITLE: Durant's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Durant Schoon

The configuration depends on Org mode. [[file:init.el][init.el]] sets up a few initial
GUI settings, bootstraps [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], and loads [[file:config.org][config.org]], which is
where the majority of the configuration magic happens.

Gratitude to Daniel Mai for showing me his awesome set up and making
some Emacs tutorials with me. Update: we had originally made playlists
under the YouTube account Emacculate but we lost it and had to
recreate it. Here are the playlists we salvaged under a new name:
[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWyjsLu0O5LOL6zbrUhDYfw/playlists?shelf_id=0&sort=dd&view=1][Still Emacsing]] which we hope to update with something close to our
original video descriptions.
